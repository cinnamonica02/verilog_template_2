# Sample testbench for a Tiny Tapeout project

This is a sample testbench for a Tiny Tapeout project. It uses [cocotb](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/) to drive the DUT and check the outputs.
See below to get started or for more information, check the [website](https://tinytapeout.com/hdl/testing/).

## Setting up

From the repository root, sync the RTL test environment:

```sh
uv sync
```

JAX is optional and CPU-only by default:

```sh
uv sync --extra jax
```

The simulator itself must also be installed separately. The Makefile expects
Icarus Verilog by default.

## How to run

To run the RTL simulation:

```sh
uv run make -B
```

To run gatelevel simulation, first harden your project and copy `../runs/wokwi/results/final/verilog/gl/{your_module_name}.v` to `gate_level_netlist.v`.

Then run:

```sh
uv run make -B GATES=yes
```

If you wish to save the waveform in VCD format instead of FST format, edit tb.v to use `$dumpfile("tb.vcd");` and then run:

```sh
uv run make -B FST=
```

This will generate `tb.vcd` instead of `tb.fst`.

## How to view the waveform file

Using GTKWave

```sh
gtkwave tb.fst tb.gtkw
```

Using Surfer

```sh
surfer tb.fst
```
